This repository contains a collection of visual computing projects demonstrating different approaches to creating and manipulating 2D and 3D graphics using various technologies and frameworks.

## Project Overview

This project showcases three different implementations of visual computing concepts:

1. **Three.js Animated Sphere Demo**: A React-based 3D scene with an animated sphere
2. **Processing 3D Pyramid Animation**: A Java-based animation of a colorful 3D pyramid
3. **2D Transformation Animation**: A Python-based demonstration of geometric transformations

Each implementation focuses on different aspects of visual computing and uses different technologies to achieve similar goals.

## Projects

### 1. Three.js Animated Sphere Demo

A modern web-based 3D visualization built with React and Three.js. Features include:

- An animated sphere that follows a circular path while rotating on multiple axes
- Dynamic color changes that shift through the color spectrum
- Distortion effects on the sphere's surface
- Interactive camera controls for exploring the 3D space
- Visual aids including grid and axes helpers

**Technologies**: React, Three.js, React Three Fiber, React Three Drei, Vite

**Location**: `/threejs` directory

### 2. Processing 3D Pyramid Animation

A Java-based animation created with the Processing framework. Features include:

- A colorful 3D pyramid that follows a sinusoidal path
- Dynamic movement in a figure-eight pattern
- Continuous rotation around the Y-axis
- Pulsing scale effect (50% to 150% of original size)
- Colorful faces with different colors

**Technologies**: Processing 3.x, Java

**Location**: `/processing` directory

### 3. 2D Transformation Animation

A Python-based demonstration of geometric transformations using matrices. Features include:

- Application of scaling, rotation, and translation to a 2D square
- Transformation composition using matrices
- Frame-by-frame animation generation
- GIF creation from the animation frames

**Technologies**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Imageio

**Location**: `/python` directory

## Getting Started

Each project has its own setup and running instructions. Please refer to the README.md file in each project directory for specific instructions:

- [Three.js Project](./threejs/README.md)
- [Processing Project](./processing/README.md)
- [Python Project](./python/README.md)

## Learning Outcomes

This collection of projects demonstrates:

1. Different approaches to creating visual computing applications
2. How to implement animations and transformations in various languages and frameworks
3. The use of transformation matrices for geometric operations
4. Interactive 3D graphics in web browsers
5. Animation techniques across different platforms
